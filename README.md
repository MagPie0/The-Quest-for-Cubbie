# The-Quest-for-Cubbie
Cubbie is the beloved mascot of Cal Women in Gaming, a club at UC Berkeley. However, Cubbie wants to meet other cubbies, so they leave their friends in order to embark on a journey to find their fellow cubbies. They travel to different areas and meet companions along the way to find a home and family. However, they realize what they are looking for might have been right in front of them all alongâ€¦

This was the first game jam of the entire group and we could not be happier with our work.
If you would like to play our game :) https://magpie0.itch.io/the-quest-for-cubbie
